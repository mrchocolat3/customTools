1) get_video_length.py 
2) youtube_downloader.py 

1. Get Video Length tool takes a directory as input and gives total videos and the 
amount of time it will take to watch them all. 

2. Youtube downloader is self explanatory. You need to have youtube-dl installed in your system 
in order for it to work perfactly.
